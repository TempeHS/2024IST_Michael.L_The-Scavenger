# What I intended to create
I worked with a multimedia student who helped me come up with the idea and basis of the game. We planned to create a world where the world has been struck by climate change so severely that it becomes apocalyptic. The main character is left to wonder about this world, they get to explore the wreckage and kill enemies as well as collect supplies like meat to survive, as they attempt to tavel back home to his apocalyptic bunker. The world they wander is isolated and plagued by monsters created by adapting to these harsh conditions left by the effects of climate change. 
### Intention for enemies
For the different levels we decided on having the main character travel through different seasons, e.g summer transitions to autumn wich transitions to winter and then to spring. As the seasons change different enemies will apear to try and attack the player. These animals have become mutant, adapting to their new-found environment. For example, a Walrus that stands up on two legs, or a kangaroo with a fur coat. 
### Intention for Collectables
Throughout the game the player will need to colect as many collectables as possible. These collectables will be in the form of scrap metal or food supplies. At the end of the game it will display how many of these supplies the player has collected. This is the underlying goal of the game, other than getting back to your bunker. 

# How to play the game
On keyboard, the player can use the A & D keys to move to the left or the right ( A to the left, D to the right). The space-bar, when pressed, will allow the player to jump in the air, an the LEFT MOUSE button will swing the players sword, damaging any enemies in its radius.

On controller, the player can use the left joystick to move to the left or right. The A button, when pressed, will allow the player to jump in the air, and the right trigger button will swing the players sword, damaging any enemies in its radius.

# The Aim of the task 

The aim of the task is to design and develop a 2D game in unity. I must apply my understanding of programming and game engines to complete a fully functioning 2D game. I also need to produce a READ.md that promotes the game and our development skills to a future employer. I worked with a multimedia student who designed and drew, using the Piskel app, all of the sprites and assets that I used in the game. Below is some examples of the assets that where producede and used. 

# Assets

Here are some assets that I used in the game, provided by a multimedia student:
