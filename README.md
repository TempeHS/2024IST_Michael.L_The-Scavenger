# What I intended to create
I worked with a multimedia student who helped me come up with the idea and basis of the game. We planned to create a world where the world has been struck by climate change so severely that it becomes apocalyptic. The main character is left to wonder about this world, they get to explore the wreckage and kill enemies as well as collect supplies like meat to survive. The world they wander is isolated and plagued by monsters created by adapting to these harsh conditions left by the effects of climate change.
