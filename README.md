## How to play the game
On keyboard, the player can use the A & D keys to move to the left or the right ( A to the left, D to the right). The space-bar, when pressed, will allow the player to jump in the air, an the LEFT MOUSE button will swing the players sword, damaging any enemies in its radius.

## The Aim of the game
The aim of the game is to return home to your apocalyptic bunker after spending all day scavenging for food. Collect as many food items as you can along the way, but be warned, many retched creatures still live in amongst the rubble, and their hungry too!

# Developer Documentation

## What I intended to create
I worked with a multimedia student who helped me come up with the idea and basis of the game. We planned to create a world where the world has been struck by climate change so severely that it becomes apocalyptic. The main character is left to wonder about this world, they get to explore the wreckage and kill enemies as well as collect supplies like meat to survive, as they attempt to tavel back home to his apocalyptic bunker. The world they wander is isolated and plagued by monsters created by adapting to these harsh conditions left by the effects of climate change. 
### Intention for enemies
For the different levels we decided on having the main character travel through different seasons, e.g summer transitions to autumn wich transitions to winter and then to spring. As the seasons change different enemies will apear to try and attack the player. These animals have become mutant, adapting to their new-found environment. For example, a Walrus that stands up on two legs, or a kangaroo with a fur coat. 
### Intention for Collectables
Throughout the game the player will need to colect as many collectables as possible. These collectables will be in the form of scrap metal or food supplies. At the end of the game it will display how many of these supplies the player has collected. This is the underlying goal of the game, other than getting back to your bunker. 

## The Aim of the task 
The aim of the task is to design and develop a 2D game in unity. I must apply my understanding of programming and game engines to complete a fully functioning 2D game. I also need to produce a READ.md that promotes the game and our development skills to a future employer. I worked with a multimedia student who designed and drew, using the Piskel app, all of the sprites and assets that I used in the game. Below is some examples of the assets that where producede and used. 

## Characters

### Player
The player is a person who is living in an apocalyptic landscape, scavenging for food and supplies to bring back to his bunker. He is designed to look scrapy, as clothing is scarse in a barren wasteland. The player can move left, right, and jump up in the air to avoid spiked or climb objects. The player has a sword as well, unsheathing it when the left mouse button is clicked to kill enemies. The player has a substantial amount of health, able to take quite a few blows from enemies, as well as land on a couple spikes before dying.
