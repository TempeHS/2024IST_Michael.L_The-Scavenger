# What I intended to create
I worked with a multimedia student who helped me come up with the idea and basis of the game. We planned to create a world where the world has been struck by climate change so severely that it becomes apocalyptic. The main character is left to wonder about this world, they get to explore the wreckage and kill enemies as well as collect supplies like meat to survive, as they attempt to tavel back home to his apocalyptic bunker. The world they wander is isolated and plagued by monsters created by adapting to these harsh conditions left by the effects of climate change. 
For the different levels we decided on having the main character travel through different seasons, e.g summer transitions to autumn wich transitions to winter and then to spring. As the seasons change different enemies will apear to try and attack the player. These animals have become mutant, adapting to their new-found environment. For exampls, a Walrus that stands up on two legs, or a kangaroo with a fur coat.
